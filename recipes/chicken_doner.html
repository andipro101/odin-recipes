    <h1>Chicken Doner Recipe</h1>

    <img src="images/doner.jpg" alt="A picture of a doner" >
    
    <p>Let's talk about this recipe and why it's easy! First off, you don't need a grill, spit, or any fancy equipment. In fact, you are going to be amazed by this cooking technique. In a nutshell, you toss chicken breast in a boldly spiced yogurt marinade, wrap it in plastic to form a log shape, freeze the log, and then pan-fry thin slices of the marinated chicken. It's amazing and you are not going to believe how authentic it tastes! </p>
    
    <p>In some ways, this chicken doner kebab recipe is very similar to Greek Chicken Gyros in that it's flavorful chicken wrapped up in a pita and served with a yogurt sauce. Yet, instead of serving it with Tzatziki Sauce with cucumber like a gyro, chicken doner kebab is served with a yogurt sauce that is seasoned with za'atar along with lots of fresh garlic and lemon.</p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients You'll Need</h1>

    <h2>Chicken Meat</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken Breasts</strong> - You will need some boneless skinless chicken breasts. Chicken thighs do not work as well. </li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Paste</strong>- Just a touch of tomato paste adds a touch of umami.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain Yogurt</strong> - Both regular yogurt and Greek yogurt will work. Just make sure to use plain yogurt that doesn't have any added sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> - Any type of onion can be used, but I like to use brown onion for the most flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong> - I always use low-sodium soy sauce to control the amount of added salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> - A good extra virgin olive oil adds the best flavor, but any type of vegetable oil will work. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> - Salt and black pepper are used to season the chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong> - A mixture of curry powder, ground cumin, sweet paprika, and ground coriander adds layers of flavor. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Yogurt Sauce</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plain Yogurt</strong> - You can use regular or Greek plain yogurt that has no added sugar. </li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Always mince your own fresh garlic cloves. Store-bought already chopped garlic can sometimes taste bitter.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon</strong> - Fresh lemon juice is always the best choice. </li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> - Use extra virgin olive oil for the most authentic flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Za'atar Spice</strong> - It's a Middle Eastern spice mix that is typically made up of dried oregano, thyme, sumac, and toasted sesame seeds. You can find it in most markets. </li>
        <li><strong>Dried Oregano</strong> - Adds another layer of herby good flavor to the sauce. You can also use fresh oregano. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>To Serve</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pita Bread</strong> - You can make your chicken doners with pita bread, Lebanese wraps, lavash bread, or any flat bread like flour tortillas. Another option is to omit the bread and serve this dish with rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Veggies</strong> - Finely shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and red onions are used to top the wraps. </li>
        <li><strong>Hummus</strong> - You can also use some store-bought hummus or make your own hummus to add to the chicken doner wraps.  </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>How To Make Chicken Doner Kebab</h1>
    <p>This recipe is going to blow your mind! It's really easy and this way of making homemade chicken doner is pretty incredible. Just make sure to give the chicken enough time in the freezer and your wraps will turn out perfect!</p>

            <h2><strong>Coat The Chicken In Marinade</strong></h2>
            <img src="images/chicken-doner-kebab-process-shots-1.jpg" alt="chicken in marinade">
            <p>To begin, add all the chicken ingredients to a large bowl except for the chicken breasts. Then whisk everything together until itâ€™s fully combined. Now, add the chicken to the bowl and coat it in the marinade. Make sure that every surface of the meat is covered. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><strong>Wrap The Chicken And Freeze</strong></h2>
            <img src="images/chicken-doner-kebab-process-shots-2.jpg" alt="wraped chicken for freezing">
            <p>This next step is the key to this recipe. First, place all the chicken on a large piece of plastic wrap. Then cover it up with the plastic and roll the ends tightly to form a log. The more compact your chicken log is, the better. Now, put the chicken log in the freezer for at least 3 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><strong>Make The Yogurt Sauce </strong></h2>
            <img src="images/chicken-doner-kebab-process-shots-3.jpg" alt="making of yogurt sauce">
            <p>You can make the sauce while the chicken is in the freezer. Just whisk all the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl until they are well mixed. Then cover the sauce with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to chill.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><strong>Cook The Chicken</strong></h2>
            <img src="images/chicken-doner-kebab-process-shots-4.jpg" alt="cutting of chicken">
            <p>After the chicken log has been in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours you can start cooking. Heat about 1 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Next, unwrap the log and start to slice off thin slices of chicken. </p>
            <img src="images/chicken-doner-kebab-process-shots-5.jpg" alt="cooking the chicken in a pan">
            <p>Then add the slices to the hot skillet and cook them for about 3 to 5 minutes or until fully cooked and charred a bit. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><strong>Assemble The Kebab Wraps</strong></h2>

            <p>Once the chicken is cooked it's time to build some wraps! To do this, put a piece of pita bread on a piece of foil. Then top the bread with some yogurt sauce or hummus followed by some cooked chicken, lettuce, tomato, and red onions. I also like to add some tabbouleh salad to mine, but this is totally optional. Now, fold the pita to form a wrap and your chicken doner kebab is assembled and ready to enjoy! </p>
